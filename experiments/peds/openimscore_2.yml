# PED documentation: https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-benchmark/wiki/PED
#
# This is an example for a profiling experiment descriptor (PED) that
# defines a profiling (benchmarking) experiment for a Suricata VNF
# that is stimulated by traffic traces replayed with TCP replay.
# 
# The tested network service (NSD, VNFDs) can be found in 'nw-services/'.
